### Translate

You may provide translations for the application to see it running in your own language. Please follow these steps:

Let's say, we're adding French (`fr`) translation.

1. Fork the repository & navigate [here](https://github.com/bluecherrydvr/unity/tree/main/lib/l10n).
2. Create a new file named `app_fr.arb`.
3. Add your translations to your new `app_fr.arb` file in correspondence to existing [English translations](https://github.com/bluecherrydvr/unity/tree/main/lib/l10n/app_en.arb).
4. Send us a new pull-request. 🎉

When adding new strings, run `bin/l10n_organizer.dart`. This script will ensure that the new strings are added to all l10n files and that they are in the same location. It will also remove any unused strings. The base file is `app_en.arb`, so all strings must be added there first.

Note that the app is constantly changing and new strings are added all the time. The translations need to be updated constantly.

### Technical Details

The code uses [Provider](https://github.com/rrousselGit/provider) for state-management because it is widely known by Flutter community, doesn't bring any unnecessary complexity to the codebase & is scalable/stable enough.

Most `ChangeNotifier`s are available as singletons, though de-coupled from each other. This is important to handle things like loading app configuration before `runApp`, handling background notification button actions & few other asynchronous operations performed outside the widget tree. By having singletons, we are able to avoid a strict dependency on the `BuildContext` & do certain things in a more performant way.

### Video Rendering

We support multiple platforms and each platform uses its own rendering backend.

| Platform     | Rendering Backend | Flutter Package |
| ------------ | ----------------- | --------------- |
| Android      | MPV               | media_kit       |
| iOS          | MPV               | media_kit       |
| Windows      | MPV               | media_kit       |
| MacOS        | MPV               | media_kit       |
| Web          | HTML5             | fvp             |
| Linux        | MDK               | fvp             |
| Raspberry Pi | MDK               | fvp             |

MDK is used for Linux and Raspberry Pi because MPV has shown to be unstable on these platforms, causing crashes. Additionally, `fvp` doesn't require the user to install any additional dependencies.

### Build

The build process is pretty straight-forward. You need to have [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) installed on your system.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bluecherrydvr/unity
cd unity
flutter pub get
flutter build [linux|windows|macos|android|ios]
```

The automated build process is done using GitHub Actions. You may find the workflow [here](.github/workflows/main.yml). The workflow builds the app for all supported platforms & uploads the artifacts to the release page.

#### Linux

On Linux, a Flutter executable with different environment variables is used to build the app for different distributions. This tells the app how the system is configured and how it should install updates. To run for Linux, you need to provide the following environment variables based on your system, where `[DISTRO_ENV]` can be `appimage` (AppImage), `deb` (Ubuntu/Debian), `rpm` (RedHat), `tar.gz` (Tarball) or `pi` (Raspberry Pi).

```bash
flutter run -d linux --dart-define-from-file=linux/env/[DISTRO_ENV].json
```

#### Linux Snapcraft

To build the Snapcraft, follow the instructions [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/linux)

```bash
sudo snap install snapcraft --classic
sudo snap install lxd
sudo lxd init
snapcraft
```

#### Web

When running on debug, you must disable the CORS policy in your browser. Note that this is only for debugging purposes and should not be used in production. To do this, run the following command:

```bash
flutter run -d chrome --web-browser-flag "--disable-web-security"
```
